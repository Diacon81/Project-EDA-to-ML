# BestCars Inc. EDA to ML Project
## Individual Project by Ainhoa DÃ­az Contreras
### Introduction
#### This project involves conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of used cars. Our objective is to thoroughly understand the dataset and prepare it for potential machine learning applications, focusing on extracting crucial variables, identifying outliers and missing values, and understanding the relationships between variables.
### Project Objectives
#### - Variable Extraction: identify key variables, remove redundant features, and retain valuable ones.
#### - Data Cleaning: address missing values, human errors, correct inconsistencies in features, and remove unusable data points and features with excessive null values.
#### - Outlier Detection: analyze and adjust outliers in 'price', 'year', and 'odometer' to improve data quality.
#### - Feature Analysis: explore relationships between features such as 'price' and 'year' to understand their implications on used car valuations and their overall impact on the dataset.
### Data
#### The dataset, available in compressed CSV format (vehicles.csv.tar.gz), originates from a Kaggle challenge. It includes various features related to the condition of the car, year, price, and more. 
### Analysis Workflow
#### - General Analysis: load the dataset and examine initial data to identify anomalies and data integrity issues.
#### - Feature Relationships: conduct statistical summaries, plot correlation matrices, and explore relationships through scatter plots and histograms.
#### - Feature Analysis: focus on the distribution of key variables such as 'year' and 'odometer' using histograms to understand common values and trends.
#### - Conclusions: as the hypothetical leader of BestCars Inc., strategic decisions are based on data analysis regarding which cars to sell based on age, usage, and condition. This segment of the workflow details actionable insights for effectively managing the car fleet, concluding with recommendations derived directly from the data analyzed.
### Environment and Libraries
#### - Python: primary programming language.
#### - Pandas and Numpy: for data manipulation.
#### - Matplotlib and Seaborn: for data visualization.
### How to Run
#### This project is designed to be compatible with platforms that support Jupyter Notebooks like Google Colab, JupyterLab, and VS Code. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed and configured to successfully run the project.
### Repository Contents
#### - BestCarsInc.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the detailed analysis.
#### - README.md: this document, explaining the project structure and analysis.
